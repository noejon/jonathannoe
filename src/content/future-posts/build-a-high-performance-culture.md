title: Building a high performance culture
---

G'day Internet

I recently interviewed for a role of Tech Lead Manager at Honey Insurance.

- passed the first 7 interviews (screening, VP of Eng, Take Home Test, behavioural/Culture fit with EMs, System Design, Behavioural/Culture fit with Product).
- One last behavioural/culture fit with CTO/CPO. At the end of the interview I knew it did not go well. I usually don't ask the question "how do you think it went?" and this time for whatever reason I asked, I already knew that I had failed it. My answers were more vague than they have ever been and often not the point.

Luckily they were nice enough to let me know that I did not demonstrate the ability to build a high-performing culture. It was indeed a question I was asked and my answer was, I later realised, totally off. I described a team I have been part off as an individual contributor rather than describing how I foster high-performing teams.

It kept me thinking:

## How do I build a high-performing team

First of all, I am pretty sure that if you ask 20 people this question you'll get 20 different answers. Here is my take on this.

Brainstorming:

Communication: Open Channel, no private messages.

- between team members
- information is shared and known by everyone
- camaradery
- culture of early feedback: public vs private

Trust and collaboration
Bring your best self at work. Demand the best from your team members and in return give them your best by setting up an environment where they can thrive and grow.

Why is it important to give them the best setting?

When a team changes, someone leaves or someone joins, saying that team changes is actually incorrect. You now have a brand new team on your hands. That new team is not guaranteed to be as high performing as the one you had from the get go, and sometimes it can get even worse than that and your team might be in a very different stage (Look for the 5 dysfunction here).

### Responsibility and accountability

Difference between responsible and accountable

Accountable for their task and day to day job. When delegating tasks to them, make sure that they are responsible for it, follow up and give feedback often. You are still accountable for what you delegate.

Have high expectations for your team.

Lead by example, if you expect a behaviour from your team, show this behaviour first. We once had an issue with pull requests piling up. Although this was brought in stand up many times (continue this example)

## You owe to them to

Make sure that there is always work ready for the team.
Make sure that there is some wiggle room for innovation.
Make sure that they are able to tackle tech debt. (that might be another post at some point)

That's all folks.
