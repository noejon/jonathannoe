G'day! As I start blogging, I don't get lots of email, so feel free to reach out!

**You are a software dev and would like some private career coaching or dev mentoring sessions**, send me an email at <coach@noejon.com>

**You like what you've seen want me to work for you**, let me know what the project is and if our worlds align it could be the start of a sparkly relationship! Hit me up at <jobs@noejon.com>

**You want to know what editor, terminal, or underwear brand I wear**, visit my [uses](./uses.md) page.

**You want to know how I keep up to date with tech**, I have [this blog post](/link/to/post) where I list all the things I do to keep me up-to-date.

**You are a recruiter**, please make sure the JD is relevant to me, and send it over to <jobs@noejon.com>.

Some tips to attract an answer:

* Keep it as short as possible.
* Keep it organised.
* Avoid huge blobs of text.
