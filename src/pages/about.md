but you can call me Jon. And now you know why (noe)(jon).com. Why not (jon)(noe)? For historical reason, it's been my handle in many places.

## Who is this guy?

I'm a Junior Software Developer with 13 years experience in the industry. Along the way I had some other job titles such as software developer, mid-level software engineer, senior, tech lead, tech lead manager. In the end I am still just a junior developer learning new things every day.

I have used lots of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. Recently my focus has been more on React.js, Node.js, Express and Koa. I also discovered [Astro](https://astro.build/), which is the framework I am using to write this blog, and I have to say, it's pretty neat!

## Why this blog?

Iâ€™ve always loved writing and sharing knowledge. I started to write many books over the years, but I never really proceeded with anything and that left a little unfinished taste in my mouth. I am claiming this little corner of the internet to tell my stories and cool stuff I am enjoying doing. It's a hybrid blog where I'll talk about my experiences, both technical and as a leader. I hope you'll enjoy reading.

I believe that teaching is the best way to learn, so what I am sharing here is mostly just me selfishly wanting to learn more!

## What else?

I am married to my beautiful wife Audrey, and we have a girl and a boy.

I enjoy cooking and am always looking forward to holidays where I can cook a nice feast for everyone. I am also an on and off avid reader, lately a little bit more off than on. Here is [a list](/books) of some books that I enjoyed reading. I also like a good board game night or playing some Magic the Gathering.

## Where is this dude?

I am based in the beautiful city of Sydney ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º, that I now call home after growing up in France ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·. When you hear me talk for the first time, you'll try to guess my accent. You will most likely say that I am either French or German. That's mostly coming from my background, I grew up in the amazing region of [Alsace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alsace), just next to Germany. And we have this kind of accent over there! If you have never been, I highly recommend you visit the region twice, during summer and in December, we have some very nice Christmas markets.
