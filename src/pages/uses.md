G'day Internet!

Here you will find the software and the hardware I use. My setting today is not the same as a few years/month/weeks back, so I'll update this from time to time.

## Hardware

* **Laptop**: 14-inch (2021) MacBook M1 Pro
* **Keyboard**: The actual MacBook keyboard! And yes people often say I am a lunatic
* **Mouse**: At this point I am not even sure why you are asking! The actual MacBook track pad.

* **Monitor**: 27-inch DELL P2722HE

* **Phone**: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 4! The only time it is ever flipped is when my one year old grabs it.

## Editor and Terminal

* **IDE**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  * **Theme**: [Cobalt2](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wesbos.theme-cobalt2)
  * **Extensions**: I have lots, lots that I don't use. Will update this page when I do my yearly cleanup/look for now extension.
* **Terminal**: [Warp](https://www.warp.dev/), but also and mostly (I feel like you will again think I am a lunatic) VS Code's embedded terminal.
